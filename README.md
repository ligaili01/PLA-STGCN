The investigation of molecular interactions between ligands and their target molecules is becoming more significant as protein structure data continues to develop. In this paper, We have developed a novel deep fusion spatial-temporal graph neural network named PLA-STGCNnet for learning protein-ligand interactions from the 3D structures of protein-ligand complexes. Compared to 1D sequences for proteins or 2D graphs for ligands, the 3D graph representation of a protein-ligand complex enables a more accurate depiction of the intricate interactions between the protein and ligand.
 
Research studies have shown that our fusion model, PLA-STGCNnet, outperforms individual algorithms in accurately predicting binding affinity. The advantage of a fusion model is the ability to fully combine the advantages of multiple different models and improve overall performance by combining their features and outputs. Our fusion model shows satisfactory performance on different data sets, which proves its generalization ability and stability. The fusion-based model showed good performance in protein ligand affinity prediction, and we successfully applied the model to drug screening. Our study highlights the potential of fusion spatial-temporal graph neural network algorithms to solve complex prediction problems in protein ligand affinity prediction.
